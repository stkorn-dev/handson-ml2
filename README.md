Machine Learning Notebooks
==========================
**Note**
All credit for the code examples of this notebook goes to the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow" by A. Geron. Modifications were made and text was added by K. Zoch and S. Korn in preparation for the hands-on sessions.

This project aims at teaching you the fundamentals of Machine Learning in
python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in the second edition of my O'Reilly book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/):
